# Deep Learning Model for Water Leakage Detection using Water Sound


## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model that can detect water leakage in water distribution systems in cities by analyzing water sounds. The model uses audio data collected from various parts of the distribution network to identify potential leaks and alert maintenance teams for timely repair and prevention of water wastage.

## Background

Water leakage in urban water distribution systems is a significant problem leading to water loss and increased utility costs. This deep learning model aims to leverage audio signals generated from water pipes and other distribution components to identify potential leaks. By using sound-based detection, the model can quickly analyze vast amounts of data, making it an efficient and cost-effective solution.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train and validate the model consists of audio recordings captured from different parts of the water distribution network. It includes both positive samples (audio segments with confirmed leaks) and negative samples (normal functioning audio segments). The [Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tbrnp6vrnj/1) can be found here.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model is based on a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which has shown promising results in audio analysis tasks. The DNN model is trained on the audio spectrogram representations of the sound data. The detailed architecture and model hyperparameters can be found in the [model.py](/model.py) file.

## Usage

To use the trained model for water leakage detection, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/DevAli00/SMARTDETECTOR.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare the audio data for detection (either record new sound or use existing audio files).
4. Preprocess the audio data to generate spectrograms.
5. Load the trained model weights using `model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')`.
6. Use the model for water leakage detection on new audio samples.

## Installation
